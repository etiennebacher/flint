Title: Find and Fix Lints in R Code
Version: 0.0.6

Description: Lints are code patterns that are not optimal because they are 
    inefficient, forget corner cases, or less readable. 'flint' provides a
    small set of functions to detect those lints and automatically fix them.
    It builds on 'astgrepr', which itself uses the Rust crate 'ast-grep' to
    parse and navigate R code.
